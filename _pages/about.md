# THE DEN OF INIQUITY
## Hosted by Me IAMBEDROOM

You know there are times in your life when things have to change. This is now my time to make a change.

So, I have decided quite strongly and with much determination to delve into the world of coding. Having always been a lover of technology it seemed the logical route to take after wasting the last 20 years of my life doing nothing with it.

### What is this site  then?

Well this is a place where I will document my learning path, be it through notes, tutorials or just general tech based ramblings. Whatever it is, it will be documented here. 


> A NOTE OF CAUTION

<p class="notice--danger"> JUST A WORD OF WARNING: If you decide to follow along with any of the tutorials or notes on this site. Know that I am not an expert and am myself also learning how to do things! </p>
